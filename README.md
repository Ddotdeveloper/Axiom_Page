# What is React.js?
React.js is a widely-used, open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it allows developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently manage and update the view in response to data changes.
React optimizes performance by utilizing a virtual DOM (Document Object Model). Instead of directly interacting with the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual version of it. When the application's state changes, React compares the updated virtual DOM with the previous one and only updates the parts that have changed, making the app faster and more efficient.

# Component-Based Design
- Components are built from scratch without using any external libraries.
- The front end is divided into multiple components that are coded separately and reused throughout the application.
- All images are SVGs and are stored in the public folder.

# Future Plans
- Integrate an API for displaying random quotes on the front page so that a new quote appears each time the website is loaded.
- Implement multiple pages using React Router.
- Add sign-in and sign-up functionality with two types of users: 1. Members 2. Regular Students.
- Introduce a blogging feature where members can write and share blogs, along with short video content exclusively for our institution.
- Include features to promote specific products.
