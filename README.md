# What is React js
React.js is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, particularly for single-page applications (SPAs). Developed by Facebook, it enables developers to create reusable UI components that efficiently manage and update the view in response to data changes.
React uses a virtual DOM (Document Object Model) to optimize performance. Instead of directly manipulating the browser's DOM, React creates a virtual representation of it. When the state of an application changes, React compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one and updates only the parts that have changed, making the app faster and more efficient.
